# Chat-Bot
Developed a chatbot using a predefined intents dataset in JSON format with tags (classes like greetings, names), patterns, and responses (possible replies). Preprocessing involves nltk for tokenization and lemmatization. Built with TensorFlow, the model predicts classes, and a random response from the corresponding tag is given to the user.
